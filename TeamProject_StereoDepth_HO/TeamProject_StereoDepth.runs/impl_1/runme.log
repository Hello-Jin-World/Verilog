WARNING: [Netlist 29-101] Netlist 'top_VGA_CAMERA' is not ideal for floorplanning, since the cellview 'disparity_generator' contains a large number of primitives.  Please consider enabling hierarchy in synthesis if you want to do floorplanning.

WARNING: [Opt 31-35] Removing redundant IBUF, U_CL/inst/clkin1_ibufg, from the path connected to top-level port: clk 
Resolution: The tool has removed redundant IBUF. To resolve this warning, check for redundant IBUF in the input design.
WARNING: [Constraints 18-550] Could not create 'IBUF_LOW_PWR' constraint because net 'U_CL/clk_in1' is not directly connected to top level port. Synthesis is ignored for IBUF_LOW_PWR but preserved for implementation.
