REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 U_DataMemory/mem_reg has an input control pin U_DataMemory/mem_reg/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: U_DataMemory/dataAddr[5]) which is driven by a register (U_RV32I_CORE/U_DataPath/U_EXE_Reg1/q_reg[7]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
