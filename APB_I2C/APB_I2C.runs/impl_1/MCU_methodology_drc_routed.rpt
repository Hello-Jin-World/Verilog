2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) SDA direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (SDA) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on SDA relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on SCL relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U_Mux_Map/ready_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U_Mux_Map/ready_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
