CHECK-3#1 Warning
Report rule limit reached  
REQP-1839 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 U_FrameBuffer/mem_reg_0_0 has an input control pin U_FrameBuffer/mem_reg_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[14] (net: U_FrameBuffer/wAddr[13]) which is driven by a register (U_OV7670_SetData/pix_counter_reg_reg[7]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1839#2 Warning

The RAMB36E1 U_FrameBuffer/mem_reg_0_0 has an input control pin U_FrameBuffer/mem_reg_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[14] (net: U_FrameBuffer/wAddr[13]) which is driven by a register (U_OV7670_SetData/pix_counter_reg_reg[8]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.
