2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on ioport relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on tx relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U_dht11_control/U_count_5sec/start_dht11_next_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U_dht11_control/U_count_5sec/start_dht11_next_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U_dht11_control/receive_dht11_data_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U_dht11_control/receive_dht11_data_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 2 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
