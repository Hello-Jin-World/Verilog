TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock U_clk_gene/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and vga_clk_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks vga_clk_clk_wiz_0]

Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock U_clk_gene/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin U_clk_gene/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

There is a large setup violation of -4.564 ns between U_vga_controller/U_Pixel_Counter/v_counter_reg[7]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and U_FrameBufferRight/mem_reg_0_8/ADDRBWRADDR[2] (clocked by vga_clk_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#480 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.592 ns between U_vga_controller/U_Pixel_Counter/v_counter_reg[7]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and U_FrameBufferRight/mem_reg_0_12/ADDRBWRADDR[2] (clocked by vga_clk_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

ULMTCS-1#1 Warning
Control Sets use limits recommend reduction  
This design uses 670 control sets (vs. available limit of 8150, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 7.5 percent. This is at a level where reduction is RECOMMENDED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.
