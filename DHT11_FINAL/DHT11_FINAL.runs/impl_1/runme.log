WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net U_ultrasonic_top/U_ultrasonic/distance_next_reg[8]_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_ultrasonic_top/U_ultrasonic/distance_next_reg[8]_i_2/O, cell U_ultrasonic_top/U_ultrasonic/distance_next_reg[8]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
