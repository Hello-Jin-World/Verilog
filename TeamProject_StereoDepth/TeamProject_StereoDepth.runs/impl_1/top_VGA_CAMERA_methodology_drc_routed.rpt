TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock U_clk_wiz_0/inst/clk is created on an inappropriate internal pin U_clk_wiz_0/inst/clk. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) SDA direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (SDA) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning

An input delay is missing on SDA relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
